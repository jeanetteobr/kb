# Communication

We use [Slack](http://momentumstudentshq.slack.com/) for communication. Slack gives us the ability to have multiple channels. The ones we mainly use are as follows:

* `#cohort2` - This is a *private* channel that only your class and the staff can see. You can discuss anything having to do with class here. You might want to discuss technical stuff in a public channel, though.
* `#frontend` and `#rubyonrails` - These are *public* channels to talk about front-end development and development with Ruby on Rails respectively.
* `#general` - Mainly used by staff for notices that the entire Momentum community should know.

Ambassadors and alumni may be present in the public channels. The reason for our public tech channels is so you can not only get help from your instructors, but also from the larger community.
