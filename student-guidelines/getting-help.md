# Getting Help

Developers are problem-solvers, not wizards. Experienced developers are really good at knowing how to find out what they need to know, and where to look for that information. Part of your training here is learning to be a creative, resourceful problem-solver.

One of our goals is to make you as self-sufficient as possible, so we will push you to try to figure things out on your own using as many resources as you can.

Learning to code is hard work. It can sometimes feel like a roller coaster, with successes and failures in quick succession. Students have moments of elation and moments of despair. This is normal! Just keep working steadily, and know that it takes time for comprehension to develop.

The hard work gets easier when we help each other. It's good to ask for help, and it's good to offer help. We'll expect each of you to do both.

## Giving Help

We are a team of developers, and we will practice collaborative techniques throughout our 12 weeks.

Being open to questions and requests for help is part of the territory.

It's also totally fine if you don't want to be interrupted at times! You can signal that you are working in a focused way by letting people know in Slack that you're taking some time away by yourself, by working in one of the quiet rooms, or simply putting headphones on while you're working. If we notice that you're doing this all the time, we'll probably want to chat with you about balancing that solitary time with working in collaboration with others.

### If you feel like you're getting it

That's awesome! Offer to explain what you know to someone else. Articulating technical things is not the same as being able to write the code. This skill is necessary for technical interviews and on the job, and we will practice it often. Helping someone else will force you to really understand what you are talking about, solidifying your grasp on the concepts. It will also help you identify gaps in your understanding so that you can fill them in! It's a key part of our learning model.

If you've come to Momentum with a good amount of previous learning, or if you're picking things up especially quickly, we'll be looking to you to be a resource for other students.

### If someone asks a question in Slack

Don't wait for an instructor to answer it! Please venture to contribute your perspective if there's anything you can add. Even helping to clarify a question, or saying that you have the same question, is a contribution!

### If you just figured something out

Share your discovery and insight! Look for opportunities to help others, or share a resource in Slack.

## Getting help

Sometimes you're stuck and you need help. There are several options.

### Ask another student

You are encouraged to work together and discuss what you're working on. You can also ask each other questions, read each other's code, and learn from each other!

Be aware that there is a solitary, focused aspect of development as well, and don't interrupt someone who is in that state. If someone has signaled that they are taking some focused, heads down time, please respect that and don't interrupt their thoughts.

Slack can be a good option to let someone know you'd like to talk to them, as notifications can be turned off.

### Ask an instructor

You can always ask us general questions, following up on what we've covered in class, or anything else you've encountered and want to know more about.

Before you ask us a question about a specific code problem, be sure you've worked through the steps covered in [Assignments](assignments.md). But don't keep struggling in silence if you're really stuck. If you've struggled for 30 minutes and haven't made any progress, it's probably time to talk to an instructor.

 When you come to us with a question about code you're stuck on, we'll want you to talk about the following:
- What's the problem you are seeing? It's helpful to be able to ask your question as precisely as you can.
- What have you already tried? What results did you get?
- What did you learn when you Googled this?

### Rubber Ducking üê•

[Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) is a real technique! When you are stuck on something, sometimes all you need is to talk through the issue out loud. For this, you don't even need a real person -- you just need a listener. A rubber duck could do it!

In practice we often end up using another person as a rubber duck, and it's just a thing we developers do for each other. Know that you will at different times be a rubber duck and need a rubber duck!
