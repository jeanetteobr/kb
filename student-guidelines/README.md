# Student Guidelines

We spend a lot of time together over the course of twelve weeks. We've got a lot of work to do! You'll be introduced to a lot of new concepts, you'll write (and read) a lot of code, you'll learn to use the tools of the trade, and you'll begin to establish the habits and practices of a professional developer.

This documentation covers the how-to practicalities of our immersive course, including general rules for getting the most out of Momentum while you're here with us.

## Expectations

There's a small set of expectations that make this learning environment work. "You" is you, the student; "I" is the instructor.

- _You will ask questions without reservation._ If you have a question, ask it. Don't hide it; we can't read your mind.
- _You will attempt all assignments._ I don't expect you'll complete every one. They are hard, and half of programming is learning from our mistakes. You have to try all of them and turn them in, though.
- _You will treat everyone with respect._ You're going to meet people not like you here. You're going to wonder why someone's not getting it sometimes, and you're going to wonder why everyone but you is getting it. Learning to programming is fun but frustrating. Don't take those frustrations out on others.
- _You will not cut-and-paste code._ This is a hard-learned lesson for us. When you cut and paste code, even code you fully understand, you miss out on the learning experience. Use examples and learn from them, but even if you're using a snippet verbatim, type it out.
- _I will give you honest feedback._ I will let you know how you're doing and what you need help with.
- _I will always be affirming._ You can do this! I will never forget that and will remind you of it when you forget.

In short: I will take responsibility for guiding and mentoring you while you're here; you will take responsibility for getting the most out of this program.
