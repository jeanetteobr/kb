# Student Guidelines

We spend a lot of time together over the course of twelve weeks. We've got a lot of work to do! You'll be introduced to a lot of new concepts, you'll write (and read) a lot of code, you'll learn to use the tools of the trade, and you'll begin to establish the habits and practices of a professional developer.

This documentation covers the how-to practicalities of our immersive course, including general rules for getting the most out of Momentum while you're here with us.
