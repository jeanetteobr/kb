# How Does the Web Work?

# Requests

When you "go to a web page," your browser makes a _request_.

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.momentumlearn.com
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,
  image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_1)

# Responses

The web server returns a _response_.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 14 Nov 2018 10:36:52 GMT
Server: nginx/1.13.6
Content-Length: 31412
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

# Web servers

- Web servers read requests.
- Using the HTTP verb, the path requested, and the headers, they return a response.
- Some servers read files from disk. In this case, the path usually corresponds to the file path, like with `python3 -m http.server`. When the entire site works this way, it's called a _static site_.
- Other times, the path is used to determine what code to execute. This code returns a response. This is referred to as a _dynamic site_.

# What role does Django play?

- takes a request
- turns it into a Python object
- _routes_ the request to a _view_
- returns the response from that view

---

# Demo

Turn the shelter site into a Django site

- Create Django app
- Create "static" template
- Create view
- Create route
- Create a real template using data
- Add images and CSS
